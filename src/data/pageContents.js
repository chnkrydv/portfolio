I was added as a part for enhancements and revival of this app. After doing good amount of enhancements for some time of the already partly written source code, the second (revival) round of development started. My role now, was to lead frontend development part of the project. I got chance to add only few bits of frontend part, because shortly after start of revival I got selected to work for Pearson UK. Meanwhile I guided my fresher team mates in enhancing their understanding of JavaScript and Node.js in a great deal.",
